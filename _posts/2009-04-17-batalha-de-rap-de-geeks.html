  content: 'Interesting blog! Is your theme custom made or did you download it from
    somewhere? A design like yours with a few simple tweeks would really make my blog
    jump out. Please let me know where you got your design. Bless you '

  content: 'Its like you read my mind! You seem to know so much about this, like you
    wrote the book in it or something. I think that you can do with some pics to drive
    the message home a little bit, but instead of that, this is magnificent blog.
    A fantastic read. I will certainly be back. '

http402: Your connection got nuked and you've met your match.<br />
http402: You run a single process like a VAX with a batch.<br />
http402: I'd pass the torch to a real winner<br />
