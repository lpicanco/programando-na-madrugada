<p>- No in&iacute;cio, a terra era sem forma e vazia<br />
- Ent&atilde;o Deus criou o Java e viu que era bom<br />
- Com o Java ele levou 6 dias para escrever o c&oacute;digo-fonte do universo<br />
- No 7&ordm; dia ele botou para compilar e foi descansar<br />
- E assim, tudo teve in&iacute;cio</p>
