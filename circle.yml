# # Need to install firebase-tools so that the deploy works
# dependencies:
#   pre:
#     - npm install -g firebase-tools

# # Need to tell Circle CI how to build the site
# compile:
#   override:
#     - bundle exec jekyll build --verbose

# # Circle CI expects some kind of testing to pass in order for the
# # build to be successful and deploy. Since you don't have tests
# # you can fake it by just returning true. http://gph.is/1MLPDWK
# test:
#   override:
#     - "true"

# # How you tell Circle to deploy to Firebase. The important thing to
# # note here is the FIREBASE_TOKEN env variable. See below.
